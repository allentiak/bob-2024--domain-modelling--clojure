# Domain Modelling with Clojure

A DDD experiment.


## About

Repo for the "DDD Modeling with Clojure" workshop.

## Usage

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m allentiak.<main-ns>`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m

Run the project's tests:

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj**.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/net.clojars.allentiak/<main-ns>-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


## Hacking

### Starting a REPL

Start a REPL from the terminal:

    % clojure -M:repl

### Quick Start via Github Codespaces (Web IDE)
If you have configured your Github account, you can start the project without any other setup.  It will open a web-based vscode editor backed by a Github Codespace VM. (Codespaces is Github's hosted Devcontainer solution)

[![Open in Github Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/allentiak/bob-2024--domain-modelling--clojure)

You can also clone this repo locally, and using vscode (with the devcontainer plugin), and Docker Desktop, run an isolated, fully setup version of this application locally. Open the repo in your editor and run the command `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.
